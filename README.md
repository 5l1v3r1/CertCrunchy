Just a silly recon tool that uses data from SSL Certificates to find potential hostnames```

## What the?
It just a silly python script that either retrieves SSL Certificate based data from online sources,
currently https://crt.sh/ and https://censys.io. 
If you want to use Censys.io you need to register for a API key.

## How to use it? 
Very simply
-d to get hostnames for spesific domain
-D to get hostnames for a list of domains (just stuff it in a line delimeted text file)
-U censys.io UID (If you have one)
-S censys.io Secret (If you have one)

for the rest, im still working on those :)

## Todo:
1.) Better documentation
2.) Add the code to extract and parse x509 certs from ip ranges
3.) Better output
