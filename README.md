Just a silly recon tool that uses data from SSL Certificates to find potential hostnames
```

## What the?
It just a silly python script that either retrieves SSL Certificate based data from online sources,
currently https://crt.sh/ and https://censys.io or given a IP range it will attempt to extract host information
from SSL Certificates.
If you want to use Censys.io you need to register for a API key.

## How to use it?
Very simply
-d to get hostnames for specific domain

-D to get hostnames for a list of domains (just stuff it in a line delimited text file)  

-i to retrieve and parse certificates from hosts in a netblock / ip range (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24) 

-T the thread count, makes stuff faster, but don't over do it

-U censys.io UID (If you have one)

-S censys.io Secret (If you have one)

-o Output file name

-f Output format csv or json, csv is the default

for the rest, I'm still working on those :)

## Todo:
1. Better documentation
